# Password-Generator
The Random Password Generator is built to lets users customize secure passwords by choosing their preferred length and types of characters like uppercase letters, digits, and special symbols. It works by creating a character pool based on these selections, then randomly picking from that pool to form a password of the desired length. The script uses Pythonâ€™s built-in string and random modules to simplify the process and ensures flexibility for different security needs. It even prompts users interactively, making it practical for everyday use. To level it up by guaranteeing at least one character from each selected category for extra strength?
